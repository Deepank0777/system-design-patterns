The issue in this example is
1. Animal is a base class that every other class extends
    1.1. Animal is base class/parent and rest are sub classes
2.  Animal has a function fly and when it was written we had only bird type animals
    moving forward as the code started growing we have to make it functional for Dogs etc
3. When a Dog was created we did method override of fly() and returned "can't fly"
4. Codebase even grew further we had to add Lion
5. This time again as a only option we had to override the function and returned "can't fly"
6. Issue: code repatability, can't reuse the code
